# Investigating overtreatment: higher rates of hysterectomy among premenopausal patients in the South <br>
This repository includes the documentation and code that created the analytic dataset and performed analysis used to evaluate whether symptom severity can explain higher 
hysterectomy rates among premenopausal non-Hispanic Black versus White patients in the U.S. South in the 2023 *Obstetrics and Gynecology* paper,
"Ethnoracial Differences in Premenopausal Hysterectomy: The Role of Symptom Severity." 

There are two separate files for this analysis. <br>
01: CHC_overtx_01_data_creation_for_github.sas creates the variables and measures of comorbidities used in the analysis <br>
02: CHC_overtx_02_analysis_for_github.sas contains statistical analysis that produce results discussed in paper
